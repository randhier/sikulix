## USAGE ##
## Installation
mvn install

## Run Tests (uses TestNG)
mvn test
# Restrictions
#### Required ENV variables
SPOTIFY_USER = Spotify user name

SPOTIFY_PASSWORD = Spotify user password
#### Spotify app
Installed and connect to DB/backend
Logged out of any user (I tried to find a way to launch in new secession but could not)

# Improvements
* Test on Windows box (I don't have one to verify)
* Launching app in new secession where the previous username is not populated in the Username text box. This caused me to click on the login logo and tab to the usename box instead of looking for an image of an empty one.
